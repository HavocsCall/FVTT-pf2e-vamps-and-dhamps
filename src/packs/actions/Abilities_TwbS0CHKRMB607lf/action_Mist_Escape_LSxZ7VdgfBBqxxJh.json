They can take move actions towards their coffin even though they are at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.</p><p></p><p>You return at 1 HP and add 3 Drained to your current Hunger and the drained value immediately begins to increase each day as outlined in Vampire Ancestry.</p>",
